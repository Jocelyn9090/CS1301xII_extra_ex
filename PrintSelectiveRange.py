#We have to traverse through all the values between the
#minimum and maximum. Thus, it is appropriate to use a
#for loop since we the range.
#
#The first if-statement inside the for loops checks to see if we 
#are looking for even values. If so, then it goes to the next
#if statement to make sure it only prints the even. If not, we
#only print the odd number, which would have a remainder 
#of 1 when divided by 2.
#
#Notice that we have to use maximum + 1 because there may
#be cases where the maximum value may be part of the 
#expected output.
#
#Notice that we donâ€™t have to write even == True because
#even is a boolean value, making it redundant.
